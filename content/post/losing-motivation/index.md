# Losing Motivation as a Hacker (and How I'm Fighting Back)

It feels weird.  
You know when your dream was to do what you are doing now, but when it finally becomes your job, it just feels exhausting.  

Don’t get me wrong, I still love hacking. But the excitement isn’t the same anymore. I wake up knowing my job will be tiring instead of looking forward to learning and breaking something new. That shift in mindset hurts more than I expected.

## ⚠️ What Triggered It?

- **Burnout** → I chased certifications last year like my life depended on it. I grinded every day, no real rest.  
- **Imposter syndrome** → No matter what I achieve, I feel like it’s not enough.  
- **Comparison** → Watching others do better. *Comparison is the thief of joy.*  
- **Too many goals** → Red teaming, pentesting, reverse engineering, security engineering. I wanted everything at once. Ended up doing nothing. Spent more time *thinking about the process* instead of *enjoying the results*.  

## ⬇️ My Lowest Point

The lowest moment?  
Me sitting in front of my monitor, doing absolutely nothing. Just staring at the screen, feeling empty. Like all the fuel was gone.

## 💡 The Realization

That’s when it hit me:  

- Life isn’t about chasing **verifications, certifications, or CTF flags**.  
- It’s about the **journey of growth**.  
- I need to push, but not to the point where I break.  
- I need to **enjoy the journey**, not just obsess over the destination.  

## 🔁 The Recovery Plan

I’m not fixed yet, but here’s how I’m clawing my way back:  

**Habits**  
- Writing more (like this blog)  
- Reading reports and findings, to learn from real-world cases  

**Mindset**  
- Aim for **1% growth every day**  
- Just keep showing up, the results will follow  

## 🧭 Final Lesson

If you’re a hacker, learner, or just grinding in life and feeling the same:  

👉 Life is more than your work.  

Yes, chase mastery. Yes, push limits. But don’t forget to breathe, enjoy, and live.  

We’re not machines, we’re humans on a journey. And that’s what makes hacking beautiful.  

*"Be a ghost, be unnoticed. If they do, it’s because you wanted to."*
